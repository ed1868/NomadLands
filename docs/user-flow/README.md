## Test Data Templates

### Agent Deployment Form Test Data
```json
{
  "name": "Test Email Classifier",
  "description": "Automatically classifies emails into categories like urgent, spam, or promotional",
  "category": "productivity",
  "configuration": {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "maxTokens": 1000,
    "systemPrompt": "You are an AI assistant specialized in email classification. Analyze email content and categorize it appropriately."
  },
  "pricePerCall": "0.05",
  "currency": "USD",
  "accessType": "public",
  "environment": "production",
  "tags": ["email", "classification", "productivity", "automation"]
}
```

### User Profile Test Data
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "+1-555-0123"
}
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Successful Deployment
- Agent appears in deployment list with "Active" status
- Unique API endpoint is generated
- Analytics show zero usage initially
- All configuration settings are preserved

### Successful Authentication
- User redirects to dashboard after login
- Navigation shows authenticated state
- User profile information is displayed
- Logout functionality works correctly

### Marketplace Functionality
- All agents load with proper styling
- Search and filtering work as expected
- Agent details pages show complete information
- Purchase flows initiate correctly

## Known Issues & Limitations
- This is an MVP implementation
- Agent execution uses simulated responses
- Payment processing is in test mode
- Some advanced analytics features are placeholders

## Screenshots Documentation
Screenshots of each step are captured in the `screenshots/` folder within this directory, organized by workflow section.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication Fails:** Verify test credentials are correct
2. **Page Won't Load:** Check that the server is running on port 5000
3. **Form Submission Errors:** Ensure all required fields are filled
4. **Navigation Issues:** Clear browser cache and refresh

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Monitor network tab for failed API requests
- Verify server logs for backend errors
- Ensure database connection is established
